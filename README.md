# Data Privacy: Measuring Digital Footprints

## Summary

An installation that makes people more aware about their data privacy by artistically representing their digital footprint.

## Context
Every day, whether we want to or not, most of us contribute to a growing portrait of who we are online; a portrait that is probably more public than we assume.
This portrait helps companies target content at specific markets and consumers, helps employers look into your background, and helps advertisers track your movements across multiple websites. Whatever we do online, we might be leaving our digital footprints behind.

Our digital footprint paints a picture of who we are and its unique to every individual.
Surprisingly very few people are aware about it. It's important to be conscious of the impact and the consequences of the footprint we leave behind.

This installation aims at making people more conscious about their online activity. It also gives a artistic representation to a person’s intangible digital footprint.


## Component Parts

Hardware - iPad, Foam Core Casing  
Software - P5.js Sketch hosted online  
Input - Selecting choices based on every question  
Output - Abstract visual representation of your footprint based on your choices  
Data - User’s answers were translated using an in-built logic that is represented in an abstract shape. The shape will show a person's digital footprint unique to every individual.  

The following graphical representation shows the components within the whole system:

### How the Footprint graphic is Mapped:

Radar (Spider) Chart was used as an inspiration.

Each of the 7 questions will form individual axes which have been arranged radially around a point. The value of each aspect is depicted by the node (anchor) on the spoke (axis) ranging from 0 to 100 percent. Every option selected represents one circle holding a value of 25 percent. A line is drawn connecting all the node together forming a shape. And thus, you get your footprint with unique to every individual.

The following poster would be put alongside the installation. It will also set the context for the user before they start to interact with the installation.

## Challenges

- Building the logic for the transformation of user's data to footprint's shape.
- Stitching components of P5 sketch.
- Integrating thermal printer to P5 for the users to take their footprint as a souvenir. (Due to time and technical constraints, this feature is still unimplemented)


## Timeline

- Week 1: Research + Proposal Creation
- Week 2: Research + Exploring Footprint Representations on P5
- Week 3: Stitching P5 Sketch Prototype together + Iterations on Footprint Representations
- Week 4: Refining P5 Sketch + Trying to integrate the Thermal Printer
- Week 5: Final Presentation + Installation Setup (Building foam core frame for iPad)
